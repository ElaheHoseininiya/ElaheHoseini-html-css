        <h1>overflow: visible</h1>
        <p>
          By default, the overflow is visible, meaning that it is not clipped
          and it renders outside the element's box:
        </p>

        <div class="visible-box">
          You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control
          of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content
          overflows an element's box.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="scroll">
        <h1>Overflow: scroll</h1>

        <p>
          Setting the overflow value to scroll, the overflow is clipped and a
          scrollbar is added to scroll inside the box. Note that this will add a
          scrollbar both horizontally and vertically (even if you do not need
          it):
        </p>

      <div class="atuo">

        <p>
          The auto value is similar to scroll, only it add scrollbars when
          necessary:

      <div class="hidden">
        <h1>Overflow: hidden</h1>

        <p>
          With the hidden value, the overflow is clipped, and the rest of the
          content is hidden:
