            The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup
            language for documents designed to be displayed in a web b rowser.
            It defines the content and structure of web content . It is often
            assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
            scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML
            documents from a web server or from local storage and render the
            documents into m ultimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure
            of a web page semantically and originally included cue s for its
            appearance. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages With
            HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms
            may be embedded into the rende red page. HTML provides a means to
            create structur ed documents by denoting structural semantics for
            text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quot es, and other
            items. HTML elements are delineated by ta s, written using angle
            brackets. Tags such a tly introduce content into the page. Other
            tags such as urround and provide information about document text and
            may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags
            but use them to interpret the content of the page. TML can embed
            programs written in a scripting langu age such as JavaScript, which
            affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS
            defines t he look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Cons
            ortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current m aintainer
            of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit
            presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A fo rm of HTML, known as HTML5,
            is used to display video and audio, primarily using theelement,
            together with JavaScript.
