            <p>CSS is designed to enable the separatin of content and
                and fonts.This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and 
                control in the  specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by sepecifying the relevant CSS in a 
                seoarate .css file,which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content ;and enable the .
                <span >css file to be cached to imprpove  the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting. </span> 
                    Sparation of formatting and  content also  makes it feasible to presnet  to the same markup page in different styles  for differentrendering methods, such as on-scree, in print , by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on 
                    Braile-based tactile devices, CSS also has rules for alternate formatting 
                    if  the content is accessed on a mobile device.

                    In 1980,physicist Tim Berners-Lee,a control at CERN,prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share  documents.
                    <span>In 1989,Berners-Lee worte a memo proposing an Internet-based  hypertext systemBerners-Lee specified HTML and worte  the browser and server software in late 1990.
                    </span>
                    That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems enginer Robert  Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project  was not formally adopted  by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990,Berners-Lee listed "some of the many arease in which hypertext is used";
                    an  encyclopedia is the first entry.The first publicly available description of HTML  was a document called "HTML Tags",first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 191It describes 
                    18 elements comprising the initial, relavely simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag,these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid,an in-house 
                    Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documetation format at CERN.Eleven of elements still exist in HTML4.
